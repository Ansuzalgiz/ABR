- .4mm nozzle

Supports should only be required for the flywheel cage

# Assembly

# Purchasing 3D Printed Parts

I sell the [latest revision of the 3D printed parts on Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/634103494/nerf-abr-3d-printed-parts-kit).

# Issues
## Jams when using cheap Lightake 12rd Nerf magazines
I think this is due to the magazine not feeding darts fast enough. It might also be due to the tight magazine well squeezing the magazine. 

# TODO
## BOOMco. conversion
Add alternate barrel to adapt blaster to use BOOMco. darts using [Boomtendo's Nerf->BOOMco. magazine feed lip](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2853522). 

## OpenFlywheelProject Eclipse compatability
Add alternate barrel and flywheel motor mount of OFP Eclipse flywheels

## Document proper assembly instructions
Create some nicer assembly instructions than a imgur gallery. 

# Contributing
The project was designed using Fusion 360, under their hobbyist license. Upon updating the Fusion 360 project, export and override the changed part STLs.
