# Printing Parameters
Prototypes were printed using these parameters:
- PLA
- .2mm layer height
- .4mm nozzle

Supports should only be required for the flywheel cage

# Issues
## Jams when using cheap Lightake 12rd Nerf magazines
I think this is due to the magazine not feeding darts fast enough. It might also be due to the tight magazine well squeezing the magazine. 

# TODO
## BOOMco. conversion
Add alternate barrel to adapt blaster to use BOOMco. darts using [Boomtendo's Nerf->BOOMco. magazine feed lip](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2853522). 

# Contributing
The project was designed using Fusion 360, under their hobbyist license. Upon updating the Fusion 360 project, export and override the changed part STLs.
